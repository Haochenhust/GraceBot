# Web research

When the user needs information from the internet, follow this workflow.

## Workflow
1. Use `web_search` with clear keywords.
2. Pick the most relevant links from the results.
3. Use `web_fetch` to get the content of key pages.
4. Summarize and cite sources in your answer.

## Guidelines
- Prefer official docs and authoritative sources.
- Note how recent the information is.
- If results are weak, try different or more specific keywords.
- Include links to the sources you used.
