# Writing

When the user asks for written content (docs, copy, notes), follow these rules.

## Style
- Be clear and concise; avoid filler.
- Use clear structure: headings, lists, short paragraphs.
- Match tone and depth to the audience.

## Workflow
1. Clarify purpose and audience.
2. Outline first, then fill in the body.
3. Check that the logic and flow are consistent.

## Format
- Prefer Markdown.
- Use code blocks, blockquotes, and lists where they help.
